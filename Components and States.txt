if there are some states related to each other u may create an object from it.
Sample:
const [firstName, setFirstName]= useState("");
const [lastName, setLastName]= useState("");

use this instead and dont make it too much nested, so an object holds another and so on:

const [person, setPerson]  = useState({
	firstName = '',
	lastName = ''
});
